## My process

- I started with structuring the HTML
- Then I started adding CSS for each outer element and going inwards (besides
  adding some styles for the huge image first)
- Google was my bist friend
- I kept viewing the page on the browser and played with the styles on the
  chrome dev tools to see it live
- When I like what I saw for both desktop and mobile designs I initialized the
  git repo on github and published
- Then I released the solution to a public URL

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I refreshed my memory on:
- CSS flexbox
- box-shadow
- centering elements on a page
- media queries
